# AI usage disclosure

We used AI tools to:
- plan project structure and GitHub workflow;
- generate initial HTML/Bootstrap templates for navbar, layout, and contact form.
- Improve mobile layout and unify shared styles
- Add a common styles.css with mobile-focused tweaks: larger typography, centered headers, full-width buttons, and comfortable form field heights
- Connect the shared stylesheet on all pages to keep spacing, container widths, and layout consistent
- Update footer copyright to use an ASCII entity and avoid potential encoding issues
All code was manually reviewed, integrated, and tested by the team.
